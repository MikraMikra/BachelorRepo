The dataset includes 72 images.
1 are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 13 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
